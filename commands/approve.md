Read the artifact first: `TASK.md` for design, `plan.json` for plan, or
`REVIEW.md` for self-review. Ask the human to confirm it is what they want.

Only then run `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/codeflow" approve $ARGUMENTS --json`. Never approve on your own,
and re-run the matching step if the artifact changed.
