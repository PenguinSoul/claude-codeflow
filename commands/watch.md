description: Read the pull request checks without merging
allowed-tools: Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/codeflow:*)
---

Run `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/codeflow" watch --json` for a one-shot snapshot. Use `--wait` only when the
human explicitly asks to wait for checks. Bound the wait with `--timeout <seconds>`
and `--interval <ms>`; a timeout is reported, not treated as a failure.

Report the check state. Never merge and never rerun an unrelated failing job
without the human's request.
